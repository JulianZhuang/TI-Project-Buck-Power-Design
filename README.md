This project is a collaboration between SJSU and Texas Instruments. Our project goal is to design and simulate a DC/DC power supply that delivers three output rails: 5V, 3.3V, 1.8V all at 1A of current. We will be considering cost, size, and efficiency in our design. We will use TI simulation tools Webench, Powerstage Designer, and PSpice for TI to design and test a schematic. We will write a test report to explain the design decisions and explain how the customers design considerations were prioritized.
